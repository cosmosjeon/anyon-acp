# Security Engineer Module Agent Example
# NOTE: This is a HYPOTHETICAL reference agent - workflows referenced may not exist yet
#
# WHY THIS IS A MODULE AGENT (not just location):
# - Designed FOR BMM ecosystem (Method workflow integration)
# - Uses/contributes BMM workflows (threat-model, security-review, compliance-check)
# - Coordinates with other ANYON Method agents (architect, dev, pm)
# - Included in default BMM bundle
# This is design intent and integration, not capability limitation.
